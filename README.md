Writing in progress, please come back soon for completed guide....

DESCRIPTION: A basic guide on getting a lite version of Tuxborn working on Valve's Steam deck, along with my advice, warnings, and random thoughts.

PREAMBLE: So, you wanna run a gigantic modified Skyrim install on your Steam deck. You wanna do it with one of the big, famous LOs like Tuxborn, but you don't have an actual gaming PC to run Wabbajack off of. 


First, let's start off with a high-level overview:
  1) Install Skyrim: must have a clean install- no ifs, ands, or buts.
  2) Start Skyrim and get to the menu to initialize inis and configs. Close once done. 
  3) Mod Organizer 2: download and install the rockerbacon version of MO2 for Linux.
  4) Configure M02 with your Skyrim Install: it will ask you for a clean prefix, ignore this and use as-is.
  5) Download and Install Mods: should need no explanation.
  6)
