Tuxborn Lite on Steam Deck

Description

A basic guide on getting a 'lite' version of Tuxborn working on Valve's Steam Deck, along with my advice, warnings, and random thoughts.

Preamble

So, you wanna run a gigantic modified Skyrim install on your Steam Deck. You wanna do it with one of the big, famous load orders like Tuxborn, but you don't have an actual gaming PC to run Wabbajack. You also might be something of a masochist with a lot of time on your hands. Well, you're in good company.

This guide covers my journey to getting a reduced/'lite' version of the Tuxborn load order running on my Deck.

Note: This guide is not perfect or exact. I will not cover every glitch I encountered, only the major/CTD ones. I may also get details or processes wrong and will assume you are capable of basic debugging or Google-fu.

Above all else, I assume that you are patient—this process is long and often frustrating. It will pay off in spades, but only if you can handle it.

Why a Reduced/'Lite' Version?

Tuxborn is designed with the Steam Deck in mind, but there are some challenges:

1️⃣ Wabbajack Requires a Windows PC

Tuxborn normally requires a Windows PC to prepare the installation before transferring it to the Deck. However, Wabbajack does not support Linux.

This guide circumvents that limitation—every step can be followed natively on the Deck without a PC.

Recommended Hardware:

USB-C Dongle – To connect a keyboard and mouse (MnK)

Mouse & Keyboard – I found a Razer mouse at Goodwill for $1.50 and a nice clicky keyboard for $6. Don't give Bezos more money; support your local thrift store.

You can do it without MnK (using the touchscreen and Steam Deck’s keyboard), but it will be painfully clunky.

2️⃣ No Supermodel NPCs

Tuxborn is a great load order, but it includes mods like CBBE and Himbo, which I personally don’t care for.

Removing these mods also eliminates several dozen required compatibility patches, making the list:

More manageable ✅

More stable ✅

Easier to debug ✅

I replaced them with simpler, more accessible alternatives.

3️⃣ Tuxborn is Huge

Tuxborn has over 1,500 mods, which significantly increases load times.

My lite version has ~570 mods.

It takes my Deck about 2 minutes to spin up from Mod Organizer 2 (MO2).

A full Tuxborn setup takes much longer.

If you're playing on a short commute, waiting for Skyrim to load might not be ideal.

A shorter list means:

Faster load times 🚀

Fewer patches needed 🛠️

Easier debugging 🔍

🛠️ High-Level Setup Overview

1️⃣ Install Skyrim

Ensure you have a clean install—no mods, no tweaks, nothing.

2️⃣ Start Skyrim

Launch the game once and get to the main menu to generate .ini and config files.

Close Skyrim afterward.

3️⃣ Install Mod Organizer 2

Download and install the Rockerbacon version of MO2 for Linux.

4️⃣ Configure MO2

Set it up with your Skyrim install.

When it asks for a clean prefix, ignore this and use the default setup.

5️⃣ Download & Install Mods

This step needs no explanation. 😎

6️⃣ ... (More steps coming soon!)
